KEY MISSION: The goal of this project is to produce, for the proposed vanilla farming revenue streams detailed in Terra35.pptx a detailed operational list of goods and services along with costs and source references from the web of what we used to help formulate the lists and where the cost figures came from.

DETAILS:

Terra35.pptx is a high level overview of the vanilla business which is the subject of this costing project.

Slide 8 is probably most pertinent to get started in defining the inventory list of items we need to get costs for – particularly the 3 revenue streams:

    - Grow and Produce (greenhouse growing, starting with a 5000 sq. foot building – we grow, then outsource curing and extraction to produce Terra35 branded product for sale). Note that we do not need to pay for the greenhouse/building or the technology (IOT sensors) as they are already in place, but we would need to pay for the build out of the grow (trellises, grow boxes, wire, substrate to grow in, fertilizer etc.) as well as resource costs per month (water, fertilizer, energy consumption).
    - Partner and Produce (private label or white label extract that we can brand and sell as Terra35)
    - Make & Produce (cell agriculture – growing vanilla in the lab and producing a product ready to sell) 

 

We also need to estimate: cost of marketing, PR, communications services (call it another cost area) as well as any regulatory costs (Another cost area) to make our product commercial-ready for sale; and any other likely business expenses.


Our goal is to build a detailed operational list of goods and services we will need and get any costs with references for sources for those. We can use this as a started to validate costs and start building out the financial model.
