# Water Consumption and Costs Research - Vanilla Operations in Oregon City
**Task 2.16 - Terra35 Vanilla Operations Cost Analysis**  
**Research Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Location**: Oregon City, Oregon  
**Application**: Water consumption analysis for 5,000 sq ft vanilla greenhouse plus processing operations with recycling systems  

## Executive Summary

Vanilla cultivation and processing operations require significant water consumption for irrigation, climate control, cleaning, and processing activities. Oregon City municipal water rates for 2025 average $4.50-6.80 per CCF (748 gallons), with commercial/industrial rates including base charges and usage tiers. A 5,000 sq ft vanilla operation with processing facility requires 15,000-40,000 gallons/month (20-54 CCF), resulting in annual water costs of $1,200-4,400 before recycling systems. Implementation of water recycling can reduce consumption by 60-85%, achieving near-zero waste targets while reducing operational costs.

**Key Findings**:
- **Oregon City Rates**: $4.50-6.80 per CCF (748 gallons) for commercial users in 2025
- **Vanilla Water Needs**: 3-8 gallons per sq ft per month greenhouse irrigation
- **Processing Water**: Additional 5,000-15,000 gallons/month for extraction and cleaning
- **Recycling Potential**: 60-85% water recovery possible with advanced systems
- **Annual Costs**: $1,200-4,400 without recycling, $200-900 with 80% recycling efficiency
