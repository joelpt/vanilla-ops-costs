# Vanilla Vine Trellis Systems Research - Commercial Greenhouse (5000 sq ft)
## Terra35 Vanilla Operations Cost Analysis - Task 2.3

**Research Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Target Application**: 5000 sq ft commercial greenhouse vanilla cultivation  
**Requirements**: Support for Vanilla planifolia (climbing orchid) with 30-50% shade integration  

---

## Executive Summary

Vanilla vines (Vanilla planifolia) are climbing orchids requiring specialized trellis support systems in commercial greenhouse operations. Key requirements include vertical posts every 6-8 feet, horizontal supports every 2-3 feet, textured surfaces for vine grip, and integrated shade cloth (30-50%) for optimal growing conditions. Research identified multiple approaches ranging from traditional wooden post systems to modern galvanized steel structures.
