# Owned vs Purchased Renewable Energy ROI Analysis
**Task 2.25 - Terra35 Vanilla Operations Cost Analysis**  
**Research Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Application**: ROI comparison of owned renewable energy systems vs purchased renewable energy programs for vanilla operations (excluding on-site solar/wind)  

## Executive Summary

Since on-site solar/wind installation is excluded per project scope, owned renewable energy options focus on power purchase agreements (PPAs), virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), and renewable energy credit (REC) purchases. Analysis shows purchased renewable programs through PGE ($1,700-8,000/year premium) offer superior economics compared to owned renewable investments requiring $50,000-200,000+ commitments. Community solar subscriptions provide the best value at 10-15% below retail rates while delivering renewable benefits. Virtual ownership through PPAs requires minimum 1 MW scale unsuitable for individual vanilla operations.

**Key Findings**:
- **Purchased Programs**: $1,700-8,000/year with no capital investment
- **Community Solar**: $800-2,800/year savings vs retail rates  
- **PPAs**: Require 1+ MW minimum, unsuitable for single operation
- **RECs Only**: $300-800/year for renewable certificates without energy
- **Recommendation**: Purchased programs provide optimal cost/benefit ratio

## Renewable Energy Ownership Models

### Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs)

**Structure and Requirements**:
- **Minimum Size**: Typically 1-10 MW capacity contracts
- **Contract Terms**: 10-25 year agreements with fixed pricing
- **Financial**: Corporate balance sheet requirements, credit qualification
- **Risk**: Price volatility and market exposure through contract for differences
- **Geographic**: Can be located anywhere within same grid region

**VPPA Economics for Large Scale**:
- **Pricing**: $0.025-0.045/kWh for wind, $0.030-0.055/kWh for solar
- **Vanilla Operation Scale**: 25,000 kWh/month = 300 MWh/year
- **Minimum VPPA**: 1 MW = 2,200+ MWh/year (7x larger than operation needs)
- **Conclusion**: Scale mismatch makes VPPAs impractical for individual operation

### Physical Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)

**Traditional PPA Structure**:
- **Direct Offtake**: Purchase power directly from renewable generation facility
- **Transmission**: Requires transmission rights and scheduling coordination  
- **Minimum Size**: 500 kW - 5 MW typical for commercial PPAs
- **Contract Terms**: 15-25 year fixed price agreements
- **Risk**: Transmission, balancing, and market risks

**PPA Economics Analysis**:
- **Pricing**: $0.035-0.065/kWh all-in delivered pricing
- **Current Retail**: $0.105-0.115/kWh PGE commercial rates
- **Potential Savings**: $0.040-0.080/kWh vs retail rates
- **Annual Savings**: $14,400-28,800/year for 25,000 kWh/month usage

**PPA Implementation Barriers**:
- **Scale Requirements**: 500 kW minimum far exceeds vanilla operation needs
- **Complexity**: Transmission, scheduling, and balancing require expertise
- **Risk**: Long-term price and transmission cost risks
- **Capital**: Often require security deposits or guarantees

### Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Purchases

**REC-Only Ownership Model**:
- **Structure**: Purchase renewable energy certificates without associated energy
- **Pricing**: $2-5 per MWh for regional RECs
- **Energy Source**: Continue purchasing standard grid electricity
- **Environmental**: Claim renewable energy usage for sustainability reporting
- **Flexibility**: Purchase exactly the quantity needed, no minimum commitment

**REC Cost Analysis**:
- **Small Operation** (15,000 kWh/month = 180 MWh/year): $360-900/year
- **Medium Operation** (25,000 kWh/month = 300 MWh/year): $600-1,500/year
- **Large Operation** (35,000 kWh/month = 420 MWh/year): $840-2,100/year

**REC Benefits and Limitations**:
- **Benefits**: Low cost, perfect scale matching, no long-term commitment
- **Limitations**: No price protection, no actual renewable energy consumption
- **Marketing**: Can claim renewable energy usage but electricity remains grid-sourced
- **Additionality**: Limited impact on renewable energy development

## Community Solar Ownership Models

### Community Solar Development Partnership

**Co-Development Opportunity**:
- **Partnership Structure**: Partner with community solar developer
- **Investment Level**: $50,000-200,000 equity investment for partial project ownership
- **Returns**: 6-12% IRR typical for community solar investments
- **Term**: 20-25 year investment horizon
- **Benefits**: Ownership returns plus renewable energy benefits

**Investment Analysis**:
- **Project Size**: 5 MW community solar project = $12-15 million total cost
- **Vanilla Operation Investment**: $100,000 (0.8% ownership)
- **Annual Returns**: $8,000-12,000/year (8-12% return on investment)
- **Energy Allocation**: 80-120 MWh/year (25-40% of operation energy needs)
- **Net Position**: Positive investment returns plus partial renewable energy

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Development Risk**: Project may not achieve commercial operation
- **Performance Risk**: Solar production may underperform projections
- **Regulatory Risk**: Changes to net metering or community solar rules
- **Liquidity Risk**: Limited ability to exit investment before term

### Community Solar Subscription Ownership

**Enhanced Subscription Model**:
- **Prepaid Subscriptions**: Pay 10-20 years of subscriptions upfront for discount
- **Ownership Feel**: Long-term subscription provides quasi-ownership benefits
- **Investment**: $15,000-40,000 upfront for 20-year subscription
- **Savings**: 15-25% discount vs monthly subscription payments
- **Transferability**: Can typically transfer subscription with property

**Prepaid Subscription Analysis**:
- **Standard Subscription**: $450/month for 15 kW subscription
- **20-Year Cost**: $108,000 monthly payments vs $75,000-85,000 prepaid
- **Net Savings**: $23,000-33,000 over 20 years (28-44% NPV savings)
- **Annual Energy**: ~18,000 kWh/year renewable energy
- **Payback**: Immediate positive NPV from subscription discount
