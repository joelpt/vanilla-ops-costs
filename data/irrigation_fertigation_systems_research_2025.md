- Installation labor costs (regional variations apply)

### Requires Further Validation:
- Exact Oregon City installation costs
- Specific orchid cultivation system performance data
- Local supplier availability and pricing

## Conclusion

For a 5000 sq ft commercial vanilla greenhouse operation, expect total irrigation/fertigation system costs ranging from $15,000 (basic automated system) to $150,000+ (fully automated with water recycling). The intermediate system ($25,000 - $45,000) appears optimal for vanilla cultivation, providing necessary precision without excessive complexity.

Key recommendation: Start with Phase 1 implementation and expand capabilities based on operational experience and cash flow.
