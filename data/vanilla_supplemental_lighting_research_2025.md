## Executive Summary

Research indicates that supplemental lighting **IS NECESSARY** for commercial vanilla cultivation in Oregon's 5000 sq ft greenhouse during winter months (October-March). Vanilla planifolia, being a low-light understory orchid, requires minimal supplementation compared to high-light crops, making the system economically viable.

**Key Findings**:
- **Light Requirements**: 40-80 μmol/m²/s PPFD (low-light orchid specification)
- **Power Requirement**: 12 watts per square foot (60 kW total system)
- **Equipment Cost Range**: $160,000 - $634,000 (wide range due to commercial vs retail pricing)
- **Annual Operating Cost**: ~$29,160 (6-month seasonal operation)
- **Necessity**: Oregon winter conditions (3.98 hours daily sunlight in January) require supplementation

## Research Question Analysis

### Does Vanilla Need Supplemental Lighting in Oregon?

**YES - Confirmed Need Based on Research**:

1. **Natural Light Availability in Oregon**:
   - Winter months: Only ~48 hours sunlight per month
   - January average: 3.98 hours of sunlight per day
   - Locations at 45°N (Portland/Oregon City) have much shorter winter days
   - Greenhouse light transmission: 60-70% (further reduces available natural light)

2. **Vanilla Light Requirements**:
   - Native habitat: Tropical rainforest understory (filtered light)
   - PPFD needs: 40-80 μmol/m²/s (low-light orchid category)
   - DLI requirement: 4-6 mol/m²/day
   - Oregon winter natural DLI likely below minimum threshold

## Seasonal Supplementation Strategy

### Critical Period
**October through March** (6 months):
- Oregon's DLI is limiting factor during these months
- Natural sunlight insufficient for 4-6 mol/m²/day vanilla requirement
- Supplementation necessary to maintain growth and prevent dormancy

### Optimal Operational Strategy
1. **Automated DLI Monitoring**: Measure daily natural light accumulation
2. **Supplement Only When Needed**: Use natural light + supplemental to reach 4-6 DLI target
3. **Extended Photoperiod**: 18-20 hours at lower intensity (more efficient)
4. **Cloudy Day Priority**: Focus supplementation on overcast days

### Summer Operation
**April through September**: 
- Natural light likely sufficient for vanilla's low requirements
- Possible minimal supplementation during extreme cloudy periods
- System available for other applications or maintenance

## Control and Monitoring Systems

### Essential Components
1. **PAR Sensors**: Measure PPFD and calculate DLI in real-time
2. **Environmental Integration**: Connect with greenhouse climate control systems
3. **Automated Scheduling**: Time-of-use optimization for electricity costs
4. **Spectrum Control**: Tunable LED systems for optimal vanilla growth

### Estimated Control System Costs

## Comparative Analysis: Necessity vs. Economics

### Alternative: No Supplemental Lighting
**Consequences**:
- Reduced winter growth or dormancy
- Lower annual vanilla production
- Inconsistent harvest timing
- Potential plant stress and health issues

### Economic Justification
**Annual Investment**:
- Equipment: $160,000 - $634,000 (one-time, depreciated over 10-15 years)
- Operating: $29,160 (annual electricity)
- Total Year 1: $189,160 - $663,160

**Benefits**:
- Year-round production capability
- Consistent vanilla harvest timing
- Higher total annual yield
- Plant health maintenance during Oregon winters

**Break-Even Analysis**: Requires vanilla production value assessment to justify investment

## Risk Factors and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **LED Degradation**: 5-10% output decline over 5 years (plan for replacement)
2. **Heat Generation**: Even LEDs produce some heat (factor into HVAC calculations)
3. **Light Burn**: Vanilla sensitive to excessive light (proper PPFD control essential)

### Economic Risks
1. **Electricity Rate Increases**: Oregon rates increased 11-21% in 2024
2. **Equipment Failure**: LED fixtures typically last 50,000+ hours but can fail
3. **Technology Obsolescence**: LED efficiency continues improving

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Redundant Systems**: Install 10% extra capacity for failure contingency
2. **Maintenance Contracts**: Consider manufacturer support agreements
3. **Energy Hedging**: Explore fixed-rate electricity contracts
4. **Modular Installation**: Phase installation to spread costs over time

## Recommendations
