**Task 2.18 - Terra35 Vanilla Operations Cost Analysis**  
**Research Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Application**: Growing media and substrate requirements for 5,000 sq ft vanilla cultivation using traditional bench systems  

## Executive Summary

Vanilla orchid cultivation requires specialized epiphytic growing media consisting primarily of orchid bark, perlite, sphagnum moss, and organic amendments. Research indicates initial media costs of $8,000-15,000 for a 5,000 sq ft operation, with annual replacement costs of $3,200-6,000 (40% annual turnover). The optimal growing medium blend consists of 50-60% orchid bark, 20-30% perlite, 10-15% sphagnum moss, and 5-10% organic amendments. Commercial suppliers offer bulk pricing for large operations, with premium grades available for enhanced drainage and longevity.

**Key Findings**:
- **Initial Setup**: $8,000-15,000 for complete growing media (5,000 sq ft traditional bench system)
