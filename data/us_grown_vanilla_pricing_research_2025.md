## Recommendations for Terra35

### Strategic Considerations
**Current Viability**: US domestic vanilla not cost-effective for Partner & Produce model due to extreme premium pricing  
**Future Monitoring**: Track Florida production development for potential future opportunities  
**Niche Applications**: Consider domestic vanilla for premium product lines with appropriate pricing

### Implementation Approach
**Current Strategy**: Focus on imported vanilla for cost-effective Partner & Produce operations  
**Long-term Planning**: Monitor domestic production development for diversification opportunities  
**Market Differentiation**: Consider domestic vanilla for "Made in USA" premium product positioning

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Current Economics**: $1,100/kg domestic vs $10-20/kg imported makes domestic vanilla economically unviable for bulk processing  
**Premium Positioning**: Could justify domestic vanilla for ultra-premium extract lines targeting affluent consumers  
**Supply Security**: Domestic production could provide supply chain security at significant cost premium

## Market Development Timeline

### Short-term (2025-2027)
- Hawaii production remains limited artisanal quantities
- Florida production continues research and development phase
- Pricing remains prohibitively high for commercial processing

### Medium-term (2028-2030)
- Florida production may reach commercial scale
- Pricing may moderate but remain premium to imports
- Potential for niche market development

### Long-term (2030+)
- Possible establishment of domestic vanilla supply chain
- Economies of scale may improve cost competitiveness
- Climate change may affect import sources, increasing domestic value
