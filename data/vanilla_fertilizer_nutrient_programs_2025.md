# Vanilla Fertilizer and Nutrient Programs Research
**Task 2.17 - Terra35 Vanilla Operations Cost Analysis**  
**Research Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Application**: Comprehensive fertilizer and nutrient program for commercial vanilla cultivation in 5,000 sq ft greenhouse operation  

## Executive Summary

Commercial vanilla cultivation requires specialized nutrition programs utilizing orchid-specific fertilizers, organic amendments, and beneficial biological additives. Research indicates annual fertilizer costs ranging from $2,400-6,500 for a 5,000 sq ft operation, with earthworm castings representing a premium organic component at $800-1,200/year. Vanilla orchids require low-nitrogen, balanced fertilizer programs (10-10-10 or 20-20-20 at 1/4 strength) applied bi-weekly during growing season, supplemented with calcium, magnesium, and beneficial microbes for optimal root development and flowering.

**Key Findings**:
