# Terra35 Vanilla Operations Cost Analysis - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to produce a comprehensive operational cost analysis for Terra35's three proposed vanilla farming revenue streams. The deliverable will be a detailed database of goods and services with actual costs, source references, and supporting documentation to enable financial modeling and investment planning.

### Core Objective
Create a data-driven cost model with verifiable sources for:
1. **Grow and Produce**: Indoor greenhouse vanilla cultivation (5000 sq ft baseline)
2. **Partner and Produce**: Private/white label extract production
3. **Make & Produce**: Cell agriculture/lab-grown vanilla

### Key Deliverables
- Structured cost database (JSON/SQLite) with all operational expenses
- Source reference documentation with timestamps and URLs
- Python scripts for data collection and updates
- Interactive cost analysis dashboard
- Comprehensive documentation of assumptions and methodologies

## üö® CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY RULE üö®

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: All data and numbers used in the produced documentation/data MUST be real data derived from actual legitimate relevant online sources.

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**:
- ‚ùå NO SYNTHETIC DATA
- ‚ùå NO MADE-UP NUMBERS
- ‚ùå NO ESTIMATES WITHOUT REAL SOURCE BASIS  
- ‚ùå NO PLACEHOLDER VALUES

**This must be strictly enforced! Every single cost figure must trace back to a real, verifiable source.**

## High Level Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)
- Design cost category taxonomy aligned with Terra35's system architecture
- Create database schema for cost data storage

- Execute systematic cost research for each revenue stream
- Implement web scrapers for supplier websites
- Integrate APIs for commodity/utility pricing
- Conduct manual research for proprietary/complex items
- Document all sources with timestamps

### Phase 3: Analysis & Documentation (Weeks 5-6)
- Validate and cross-reference all collected data
- Calculate derived metrics (per sq ft, per kg, monthly rates)
- Create visualizations and analysis reports
- Document assumptions and confidence levels

### Phase 4: Maintenance & Updates (Week 7+)
- Build automated update mechanisms
- Create monitoring dashboards
- Establish data refresh protocols
- Prepare handoff documentation

## Implementation Notes

### Data Collection Strategy
1. **Automated Sources** (via web scraping):
   - Equipment suppliers (FarmTek, GrowSpan, Fisher Scientific)
   - Utility rate databases
   - Commodity prices

2. **Manual Research** (requiring direct contact):
   - Bioreactor systems (custom quotes)
   - Vanilla bean brokers
   - Certification bodies
   - Insurance providers

3. **API Integration**:
   - Energy Information Administration (EIA)
   - USDA agricultural statistics
   - Local utility companies

### Quality Assurance
- Every cost must have at least one verifiable source
- Prefer 2024-2025 data; note if using older estimates
- Include price ranges, not just point estimates
- Document all assumptions clearly
- Flag low-confidence estimates for follow-up

### Technology Stack
- **Data Collection**: Python, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Requests
- **Data Storage**: SQLite, JSON, CSV
- **Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib
- **Documentation**: Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions, cron jobs

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% of critical cost categories have verified sources
- [ ] 90% of costs from 2024-2025 timeframe
- [ ] All three revenue streams fully costed
- [ ] Source documentation complete and accessible
- [ ] Dashboard functional and user-friendly
- [ ] Update mechanism tested and documented

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Availability**: Have fallback estimation methods for proprietary data
- **Price Volatility**: Document date of price capture, provide ranges
- **Regional Variations**: Note where costs are location-specific
- **Technology Changes**: Design flexible schema for emerging cell ag tech
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain focus on cost data, not business strategy
