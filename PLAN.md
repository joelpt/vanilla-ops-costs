# Terra35 Vanilla Operations Cost Analysis - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to produce a comprehensive operational cost analysis for Terra35's three proposed vanilla farming revenue streams. The deliverable will be a detailed database of goods and services with actual costs, source references, and supporting documentation to enable financial modeling and investment planning.

### Core Objective
Create a data-driven cost model with verifiable sources for:
1. **Grow and Produce**: Indoor greenhouse vanilla cultivation (5000 sq ft baseline, Oregon City location, 85¬∞F climate control, traditional bench system, Grade A vanilla for fermentation-based curing)
2. **Partner and Produce**: Private/white label extract production (processing service fees for 100+ gallon bulk orders with identified partners: Loran/Lorann, Cooks, Lochhead)
3. **Make & Produce**: Cell agriculture lab-grown vanilla (partnership with Rheaplant for R&D ‚Üí Scale-up ‚Üí Production phases)

### Key Deliverables
- Structured cost database (JSON/SQLite) with all operational expenses
- Source reference documentation with timestamps and URLs
- Python scripts for data collection and updates
- Interactive cost analysis dashboard
- Comprehensive documentation of assumptions and methodologies

## üö® CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY RULE üö®

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: All data and numbers used in the produced documentation/data MUST be real data derived from actual legitimate relevant online sources.

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**:
- ‚ùå NO SYNTHETIC DATA
- ‚ùå NO MADE-UP NUMBERS
- ‚ùå NO ESTIMATES WITHOUT REAL SOURCE BASIS  
- ‚ùå NO PLACEHOLDER VALUES

**This must be strictly enforced! Every single cost figure must trace back to a real, verifiable source.**
